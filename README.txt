The BOSEbuild Wall Mount is a 3D-printable system of components that allow a BOSEbuild
speaker cube to be easily mounted on a wall or other surface. The speaker can also be angled
in any direction using two ball-and-socket joints on the wall mounting system. This way, your
BOSEbuild speaker cube can be mounted up and off your work surface, and angled towards you to
deliver the best-sounding audio.

The wall mounting system is based on the brackets used for the HTC Vive VR system lighthouses.
For both the HTC Vive lighthouses and the BOSEbuild speaker cube, the ability to point the 
devices in a specific direction is important for the best performance.

Aside from the 3D printed components, you will need an 80mm length of M8 threaded rod, and
two wall-mounting screws to complete the build.
